- follow the datomic cloud docs getting started with a split stack instructions
- Create this policy in IAM (I called it "hyperdrive-exogenesis-extra") and add it to the Datomic Compute Cloudformation template as described here: https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/operation/howto.html#update-parameter (instructions are a little out of date regarding the exact position of buttons) putting the policy name under Optional Configuration > Existing IAM managed policy for instances.

        }
    ]
}

Per-env:
- Query-group-per-env instructions
  - follow the datomic cloud docs query group creation instructions with the following modifications:
    - name it biome-ENV
    - use {:env :ENV} for the Environment Map
    - in Optional Configuration > Existing IAM managed policy put arn:aws:iam::894809534931:policy/hyperdrive-exogenesis-extra
    - for staging restrict the max instances to 1, for production envs leave it as the default 4
  - in galvanic and cathode index.js add another clause for preventing redirection to supercollider
- Shared group instructions
  - make sure the query group or pimary compute group has no environment map and does have "Existing IAM managed policy" set (as described above)
- add the contact email address to SES by clicking the verification link sent by the setup script.

Dev:
- create an IAM user (I called mine "pharcosyle-exogenesis-local") and attach the "hyperdrive-exogenesis-extra" policy. Use this user for running the ion project locally.
