Per-env:
- terminal
  - create a git branch based off master called env-ENV and git checkout
  - `amplify env add ENV` and `amplify push`
  - push to github
- Amplify Console
  - add a new Environment Variable override USER_BRANCH mapping Value ENV to branch env-ENV
  - connect a new branch, go to "Edit target backend" and add the amplify env
  - in Domain Management add a new subdomain for ENV.hyperdrive.life
- In the env's Cognito User Pool: General settings > Policies > Only allow administrators to create users
- Add this inline policy to the lamda roles for galvanic and cathode in the IAM roles dashboard, something like "continuumLambdaRole36112573-krush" and "continuumLambdaRole6798a98d-krush" (Summary > Permissions > Add Inline Policy), call it whatever (I did "quantum_invoke_datomic_lambda_policy"). Change the Resource part (env and warpgate/jumpgate). Use staging for the dev lambdas. Use "supercollider" for any envs running in the primary group.
